# TODO

## General
- [ ] Add rule for implicit Parameter attributes with corrections that remove `=$True`, i.e. `[Parameter(Mandatory=$True)]` to `[Parameter(Mandatory)]`.
- [ ] Add rule for hashtables with corrections that surround key names with quotes.

## Measure-NewObject
- [ ] Verify that the type has a new() constructor before identifying it as an issue
